// buildAgent wires the slim hosted-cloud host integration (ENVIRONMENT.md
// # How the profile is realized — "A build-tagged slim cloud host-agent").
//
// KEEPS the same seams as the appliance that a cloud VM still needs: real PAM
// verify_password, user create/delete/set-role/set-password (usermgr), the
// health/system reporters (storage, services, time, resources, reboot, system
// resources, disk usage), and the per-app log tail. None of these touch the
// LAN, NetworkManager, or DBus.
//
// DROPS the appliance's LAN/discovery stack — no NetworkManager (netstate), no
// Avahi/mDNS publish (avahipublisher), no network watcher — because a hosted VM
// has a single provider-managed NIC and no `.local` discovery (ENVIRONMENT.md
// # Networking & discovery). LUKS/TPM unlock, the Samba allowlist, and nftables
// LAN-scoping are likewise absent. Note: the nftables package IS installed as a
// docker-ce hard dep (#241, DECISIONS.md 2026-06-23); the appliance's
// SSH/SMB LAN-scoping ruleset is absent, but a standing forward-hook DROP of
// app-container egress to 169.254.169.254 ships as a static image-baked oneshot
// (moose-metadata-firewall.service, #251) outside host-agent. A future general
// default-deny backstop would be wired here (NEXT.md # In-guest nftables).
//
// Net is left nil: with no NetworkManager there is no LAN set to report.
// GET /v1/discovery/state then reports an empty interfaces list ("not
// measured") — a diagnostic read that is moot without mDNS. A kernel single-NIC
// reader is a deliberate follow-up if a hosted consumer ever needs the interface
// name; we do not pull NetworkManager into the hosted build to get it.
//
// Built with `go build -tags hosted ./cmd/host-agent-real` for the cloud image.
// The returned cleanup is a no-op — there is no watcher or DBus handle to close.
