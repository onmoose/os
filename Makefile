# ---- Curate one or more store apps (+ optionally the landing) against the
# brain -------------------------------------------------------------------
# Post-catalog-cutover (cloud #62) there is no baked os/catalog/ to boot from —
# the brain is a thin HTTP client of the control plane. `make dev-app APP=<id>`
# restores the inner loop for authoring/curating a store app: it builds a local
# snapshot from a store checkout (STORE/apps/APP) with mkcatalog, then runs the
# normal dev stack with MOOSE_CATALOG_FILE pointing at it. The brain reads that
# file once at boot (internal/catalog/remote.go # loadSnapshotFile) and installs
# the app from it. The file is an input the brain never writes back — a box keeps
# no catalog on disk. A seed inlines each app's manifest and compose, because a
# staged file has no control plane behind it to serve the per-app document routes
# a real box fetches an install payload from (#434). Environment visibility is not
# in the seed either: a real box gets it from the ?env= on its own fetch, so a
# seeded store shows every app it was given.
#
# `make seed-catalog APPS="<id> <id> ..." [HOMEFILE=<path/to/home.yml>]` is the
# multi-app form: it seeds every named package into one snapshot and, when
# HOMEFILE is given, carries that home.yml's spotlight + groups too, so the
# curated landing page (docs/specs/APP_STORE.md # Landing page) is clickable
# locally. mkcatalog fails loudly if home.yml names an app that wasn't also
# passed in APPS — the point of seeding locally is to catch that before a real
# publish does. The store's categories.yml is picked up automatically when the
# checkout has one, so the seeded store renders the authored category labels
# rather than the readable-id fallback. (Named HOMEFILE, not HOME, so it can't
# collide with the shell's own $HOME.) APP=<id> keeps working unchanged — it is
# just the single-app case of the same underlying seed-catalog recipe.
#
# It uses mkcatalog, NOT cloud's catalog-sync, on purpose: catalog-sync publishes
# only listed:true records, but an app under curation has no verdict yet — you
# boot it to *decide* whether it is full or degraded. mkcatalog reads the
# manifest+compose directly and ignores status.yml, so no provisional listed:true
# is ever needed (and can't be committed by accident).

# The inert catalog URL and the seed file are target-specific, exported
# variables, so they are in effect for the `dev` prerequisite's recipe too — the
# brain reads both from the env, and cmd/brain defaults MOOSE_CATALOG_URL to the
# real apex (https://onmoose.network). Without the override the first background
# sync would succeed and replace the seed with the published catalog, silently
# dropping the app(s) under test. Port 1 has nothing listening, so the sync fails
# fast (same inert-URL trick as dev/test-health.sh). seed-catalog runs first and
# aborts the whole target if no app was given, so `dev` never starts against a
# bad seed. Accepts APP or APPS (+ optional HOMEFILE) exactly like seed-catalog.

# Stop the native dev stack (`make dev` runs brain/host-agent/vite outside
# Docker). Without this, `clean` leaves the brain running with the deleted
# moose.db still open (deleted-but-open inode), so it keeps serving the old
# state and the wiped DB silently comes back — `clean` looks like a no-op.
# Best-effort: pkill exits non-zero when nothing matches, hence the `-` prefix.
# The supervisor is matched by its MOOSE_DEV_AVAHI env prefix; the binaries by
# their $(DEV_DIR) path; vite by this repo's absolute path so we don't reap an
# unrelated Vite on the box.
